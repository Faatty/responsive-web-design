# Responsive Web Design Projects – freeCodeCamp

This repository contains all the projects I completed as part of the **Responsive Web Design Certification** from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). These projects demonstrate fundamental front-end development skills using HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on responsive and accessible web design.

The Responsive Web Design certification covers:

- HTML5 and semantic structure

- Mobile-first design principles
- Web accessibility best practices
- Building multi-page, responsive websites
